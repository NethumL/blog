I tried to find a reasonable implementation of it, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find one. Maybe it exists somewhere out there, but, it was an interesting little side project, so I decided to try making it myself. If you just want the code, you can get it from the GitHub repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
